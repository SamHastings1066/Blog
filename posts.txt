My first year in South Beach

A wholesome place with a kind-hearted community feel.

I'm not sure I really feel an "intellectual affinity" with this place. There are NO BOOKSTORES in south beach. You have to drive 30 minutes to Coral Gables to buy a book.

Although I have fallen in love with the drivers, most of whom, if they drive the way the do in the streets of Miami during their driving tests, would fail those tests.
